# Buffer

# Variable

Property of an individual that is studied

# Census

Study where variable is measured for all individuals in the population

# Tails

Ends of a data distribution

# Law of Large Numbers

[[Frequency#Class relative frequency|Relative frequency]] approaches true probability as the number of tries repeats

# Combinations Rule

The number of possibilities by choosing $n$ elements from set of $N$ elements is

$$
{N \choose n} = \frac{N!}{n!(N - n)!}
$$

`Read as` "N choose n"

# Multiplicative Rule

The number of possibilities by choosing one element from $k$ sets of $n_i$ elements is

$$
n_1n_2n_3\dots n_k
$$

## Multiplicative rule of probability

For independent events, $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)$

# Law of True Probability

Suppose event $A$ and partitions $B_1, B_2,\dots B_k$, then

$$
P(A) = \sum_{ i = 1 }^{ k } P(A\cap B_i)
$$

> Each of the pairwise disjoint events $E$ such that $E_1\cup E_2\cup\dots E_k = \Omega$
