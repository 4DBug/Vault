A function is **even** if $f(-x) = f(x)$ (symmetry across y-axis).
A function is **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ (symmetry about the origin).

# Substitution

Method of reversing an application of [[chain rule]] to find the antiderivative

To find the antiderivative of $f(x) = \int g(u)u' \, dx$,

1. Note that $\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}$ is the derived term of $u$ divided by $dx$.
2. Substitute $\frac{du}{dx}$ into
