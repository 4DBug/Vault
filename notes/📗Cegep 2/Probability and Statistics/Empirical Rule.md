# Empirical Rule

For data sets whose relative frequency distributions are **symmetric** and **bell-shaped**,

- ~68% of measurements fall within 1 [[standard deviation]] from the [[mean]];
- ~95% of measurements fall within 2 standard deviation from the mean;
- ~99.7% of measurements fall within 3 standard deviation from the mean.
