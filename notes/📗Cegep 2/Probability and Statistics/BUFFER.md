# Buffer

# Variable

Property of an individual that is studied

# Census

Study where variable is measured for all individuals in the population

# Tails

Ends of a data distribution

# Skewness

One tail of the distribution has more extreme observations than the other

# Empirical Rule

For data sets whose relative frequency distributions are **symmetric** and **bell-shaped**,

- ~68% of measurements fall within 1 standard deviation from the mean;
- ~95% of measurements fall within 2 standard deviation from the mean;
- ~99.7% of measurements fall within 3 standard deviation from the mean.
