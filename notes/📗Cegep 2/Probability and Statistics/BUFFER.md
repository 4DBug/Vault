# Law of Large Numbers

Relative frequency approaches true probability as the number of tries repeats

# Combinations Rule

The number of possibilities by choosing $n$ elements from set of $N$ elements is

$$
{N \choose n} = \frac{N!}{n!(N - n)!}
$$

`Read as` "N choose n"

# Union

Binary operation that yields the probability of at least one of A or B happening 

`Sym.` $\cup$

# Intersection

Binary operation that yields the probability of A and B both occurring

`Sym.` $\cap$
