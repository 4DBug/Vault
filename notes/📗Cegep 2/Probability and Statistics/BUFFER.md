# Buffer

# Variable

Property of an individual that is studied

# Census

Study where variable is measured for all individuals in the population

# Tails

Ends of a data distribution

# Probability

(Study of the) chance of an event to occur
`Sym.` $P(E)$

# Law of Large Numbers

Relative frequency approaches true probability as the number of tries repeats

# Combinations Rule

The number of possibilities by choosing $n$ elements from set of $N$ elements is

$$
{N \choose n} = \frac{N!}{n!(N - n)!}
$$

`Read as` "N choose n"

# Union

Event that occurs when at least one of $A$ or $B$ occurs
`Sym.` $\cup$

Additive rule of probability: $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$

# Intersection

Event that occurs when $A$ and $B$ both occur
`Sym.` $\cap$

Mutual exclusivity: $P(A\cap B) = 0$
`A.k.a.` disjoint sets

# Complement

Event that occurs when another doesn't
`Sym.` $A^c$ or $\overline{A}$

# Multiplicative Rule

For independent events, $P(A\cap B) = P(A)\cdot P(B)$
