# Patriarchy

Properties:

- Not primordial, but a social construct
- Men are expected to conform to patriarchy

## Origins

1. Hunter-gatherer groups
	- Gender division of labour: women gather; men hunt
		- Women reproduce so are less suitable for hunt
	- Gender balance
		- Women may be more respected because they have stable source of food.
2. Agricultural revolution
	- Gender division of labour: women spend more time inside; men spend more time outside
		- Need to have more babies for population growth
3. Emergence of patriarchy
	- Population growth
	- Accumulation of properties
	- Public / private divide: men occupy the public sphere; women occupy the private sphere; public sphere deemed more important
4. Institutionalization
	- Religion, culture, laws, etc.

## Status of women

Affected by:

- Honour / shame
	- Women may affect the honour of the family => they are protected / controlled
		- E.g. women covering their faces
- Public / private spheres
	- Public sphere: men space
		- Outside the home
		- Higher status and value
	- Private sphere: women space
		- Inside the home
		- Lower status and value

## Preference for boys

- Patrilineality:
	- Lineage
	- Property transfer
- Patrilocality:
	- Care of parents in old age
- Funeral rituals performed by sons
- Dowry payments made to groom by bride's family

> [!abstract] Patrilineality
> In a family, inheritance of properties by the male line

> [!abstract] Patrilocality
> Cultural pattern where married couple settles in the husband's home or community
