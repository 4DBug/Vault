# Caste

Hierarchical societal structure unique to [[South Asia]] where occupation-based position in society determines rank, status, privilege and power
Unlike classes, caste is rigid and inflexible; one is born into a fixed caste and cannot move caste.
Is a social construct

Often linked to Hinduism (contested)

Castes:

1. Brahmins: priests, academics
2. Kshatriyas: warriors, rulers
3. Vaisyas: merchants, farmers
4. Shudras: workers, servants
5. Dalits (also `pej.` untouchables): "dirty" workers
