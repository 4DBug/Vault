# Worldview

Mindset

Affected by:

- Generation (age)
- Gender
- Social class
- Ethnicity
	- Indigenity
- Culture
- Beliefs
	- Economics (neo-liberalism, etc.)
	- Nationalism
	- [[Religion]] / Science
- Geography
	- Climate

Why learn about worldviews:

- Promotes understanding
- Self-knowledge: earning about a different worldview = learning about our own
