# Caste System

Hierarchical societal structure unique to [[South Asia]]
Determines rank, status, privilege and power
Is a social construct

Often linked to Hinduism (contested)

> [!abstract] Caste
> Each of the social groups in the caste system

> [!abstract] Casteism
> Discrimination based on caste

## Continuity

The rigid and inflexible caste system is perpetuated by:

- Birth (one is born into a fixed caste and cannot move caste)
- Endogamy
- Occupation
- Commensality
- Ostracisation and violence against violators of caste norms
- Belief in karma (followers of caste norms reincarnate into a higher caste)

> [!abstract] Endogamy
> Marriage within a specific social group

> [!abstract]+ Commensality
> Rules of eating:
> 
> - Eat with the same caste group
> - Not eat prepared food from another caste
> 	- Can prepare food using ingredients sold by another caste
