### Upper castes

#### Brahmin

Priests, academics

#### Kshatriya

Warriors, rulers

#### Vaishya

Merchants, farmers

### Dalit-Bahujan

#### Shudra

Workers, servants
A.k.a. also other backward class (`abbr.` OBC)

## Continuity

The rigid and inflexible caste system is perpetuated by:

- Birth (one is born into a fixed caste and cannot move caste)
- Endogamy
- Occupation
- Commensality
- Ostracisation and violence against violators of caste norms
- Belief in karma (followers of caste norms reincarnate into a higher caste)

> Rules of eating:
> 
> - Eat with the same caste group
> - Not eat prepared food from another caste
> 	- Can prepare food using ingredients sold by another caste
