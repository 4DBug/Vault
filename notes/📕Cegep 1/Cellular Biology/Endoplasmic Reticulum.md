# Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

Membrane-bound [[Organelle]]
Part of the [[endomembrane system]]
Endoplasmic: within cytoplasm
Reticulum: network

## Types

### Smooth (SER)

*Tubular* shape
*No* ribosome

- Lipid synthesis
- Carbohydrate metabolism
- Drug and poison detoxification
- $Ca^{2+}$ storage (in muscle cells)

### Rough (RER)

*[[Cisterna|Cisternae]]* shape
*Has* ribosomes on its surface

- Membrane production for the endomembrane system (incl. itself)
- Synthesis of proteins destined for insertion into the [[plasma membrane]] or secretion (by ribosomes)
- Packages proteins into transport [[Vesicle|vesicles]] and sends them to the [[Golgi apparatus]]
