# Mitochondrion

Membrane-bound [[organelle]] that transforms energy with cellular respiration
pl. mitochondria

> [!info] Cellular respiration
> Produces ATP with oxygen
> glucose + $O_2$ -> $CO_2$ +  $H_2O$ + ATP + heat

Number varies with cellular activity

Has two phospholipid bilayer membranes
Inner membrane:

- smooth and permeable
- folded into cristae to increase the surface area
- contains enzymes involved in cellular respiration, e.g. ATP synthase
