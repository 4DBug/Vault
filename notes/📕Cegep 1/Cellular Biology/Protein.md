# Protein

[[Polymer]] consisting of one or more [[Polypeptide|polypeptides]]

Formed by dehydration

3D under normal conditions

> [!abstract] Globular
> (Of a protein) spherical

> [!abstract] Denaturation / renaturation
> Denaturation: loss of 3D structure when heated
> Renaturation: regain of 3D structure when cooled

## Types

Grouped by function

### Hormonal

Coordination of the organism's activities

> [!example] Insulin: regulate blood sugar

### Receptor

Response to chemical stimuli

> [!example] Receptors in the membrane of a nerve cell detect signaling molecules from other nerve cells.

### Enzymatic

Enzyme (catalyst of chemical reactions)

> [!example] Digestive enzymes catalyst the hydrolysis of polysaccharides.

### Defensive

Protection against disease

> [!example] Antibodies inactivate and help destroy viruses and bacteria.

### Contractile and motor

Movement

> [!example] Actin and myosin: contraction of muscles

### Structural

Structural support

> [!example]
> - Keratin: protein of hair, horns and feathers
> - Silk fiber: cocoon and web
> - Collagen and elastin proteins: animal connective tissues

### Storage

Storage of amino acids

> [!example]
> - Casein: protein of milk
> - Ovalbumin: protein of egg white

### Transport

Transport of substances

> [!example] Hemoglobin: iron-containing protein in blood that transports oxygen
