# Mitosis

Followed by [[cytokinesis]]

## Prophase

1. Chromatin fibers condense into discrete chromosomes
2. Nucleoli disappear
3. Microtubules from centrosomes lengthen to form the mitotic spindle
4. Centrosomes move apart to two poles (animal cells only)
5. Nuclear envelope fragments
6. Microtubules attach to chromosomes by kinetochores

> [!abstract] Mitotic spindle
> Formation that grabs chromosomes and pulls them apart
> Made of two centrosomes microtubules

> [!abstract] Centrosome
> T-shaped object that connects the microtubules
> Made of a pair of centrioles

> [!abstract] Kinetochore
> Protein located at the centromere

> [!abstract] Centromere
> Middle section of a pair of chromatids that connects them together

## Metaphase

Chromosomes move to the metaphase plate, sister chromatids facing opposite poles

## Anaphase

1. Sister chromatids are pulled apart towards opposite poles
2. Microtubules shorten

## Telophase

1. Cell elongates
2. Nuclear envelope forms
3. Nucleoli reappear
4. Chromosomes uncoil and begin to decondense into chromatin
