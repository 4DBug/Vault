# Membrane

Isolation layer made of [[Lipid#^5b5e44|phospholipid bilayer]]

## Integral protein

Proteins that penetrate the membrane
May extend through the membrane (**transmembrane**) or only partway
Some have a hydrophilic channel allowing passing

## Peripheral protein

Protein loosely associated with the membrane

## Transport across membrane

Depends on fluidity of the membrane

### Diffusion

Move solute *down* its concentration gradient (from higher concentration to lower concentration)

Passive transport (*no energy required*)

### Facilitated diffusion

Variant of diffusion that moves polar or ionic compounds, e.g. glucose

Requires a channel or carrier transmembrane protein

### Osmosis

Special case of facilitated diffusion for water, which moves from lower concentration of solute to higher concentration of solute (a.k.a. from higher concentration of water to lower concentration of water)

Requires **aquaporin** protein
Continues until the two sides are [[Solution Concentration#^d1f583|isotonic]]

### Active transport

Move solute *against* its concentration gradient (from lower concentration to higher concentration)

Requires energy provided by the hydrolysis of ATP
Requires carrier protein
