# Lipid

Function: fuel for cells
More energy efficient than carbohydrate

Not a polymer because it doesn't form a chain

Hydrophobic (insoluble in water)

## Types

### Fat

Glycerol & three fatty acids
A.k.a. triglyceride or triacylglycerol

> [!abstract] Fatty acid
> Long hydrocarbon (16-20 $C$ atoms)

Formed by a dehydration reaction
Leads to an ester linkage

#### Saturated

No $C=C$ double bonds $\implies$ max cap on $H$ atoms in the molecule
*Compact* $\implies$ *solid* at room temperature

From *animal sources*

#### Unsaturated

At least one $C=C$ double bond

Causes a bend in the hydrocarbon backbone
*Less compact* $\implies$ *liquid* at room temperature

From *plants and fish*

### Phospholipid

Choline, phosphate, glycerol & two fatty acids

[[Hydrosolubility#^3c822f|Amphipathic]]
Phosphate group (*head*): *hydrophilic*
Fatty acids (*tails*): *hydrophobic*

> [!abstract] Micelle
> Phospholipid aggregate in water (hydrophilic heads outward in contact with water, hydrophobic tails inward)

> [!abstract] Phospholipid bilayer
> Double phospholipid layer used as membrane in cells (hydrophilic head at the edges, hydrophobic tails at the core)

### Steroid

Four carbon rings

> [!abstract] Cholesterol
> Steroid that forms cell membranes and is the starting compound for other steroids
