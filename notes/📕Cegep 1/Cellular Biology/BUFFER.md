# Buffer

# Gonad

 Organ that makes the gametes (ovarie and teste)

## 2024-09-03

# Nucleus

Organelle that contains most of the genes

Nuclear envelope contains pores to allow large molecules to pass through
Nuclear lamina: network of structural proteins on the inner side of the nuclear envelope
Nucleolus: site of synthesis of rRNA

# Lysosome

Membrane enclosed sacs of hydrolytic enzymes

Digest damaged organelles & macromolecules (autophagy)

# Mitochondria

Energy transformer organelle
Produces ATP with oxygen
glucose + $O_2$ -> $CO_2$ +  $H_2O$ + ATP + heat

Number varies with cellular activity

Has two phospholipid bilayer membranes:

- Inner membrane

	- smooth and permeable
	- folded into cristae to increase the surface area
	- contains enzymes involved in cellular respiration, e.g. ATP synthase

# Chloroplast

Energy transformer organelle of plant cells
light + $CO_2$ -> glucose + $H_2O$ + $O_2$

Contains chlorophyll and stroma

> Green pigment

> [!abstract] Stroma
> Fluid that contains DNA, ribosomes, enzymes involved in photosynthesis and thylakoids

# Cytoskeleton

Dynamic network of protein fibres in the cytoplasm

## Types

###

# Cell Fibre

## Types

### Microtubule

Thickest fibre constructed from *tubulin*
Hollow rod

Functions:

- Maintain cell shape
- 

> [!abstract] Tubulin
> Globular protein

### Microfilament

Thinnest fibre constructed from *actin*
Solid rod

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Muscle contraction
- Cell mobility
- Cell division
- Cytoplasmic streaming

### Intermediate filament

Medium-size 

# Phagocytosis

# Vacuole

Membrane-bound sac

## Types

### Food

Digestion in protozoa
Engulfed bacteria in a white blood cell

> [!abstract] Protozoa
> Single celled animal-like organism

### Central

Big vacuole in plant cells

### Contractile

Pump water out of freshwater single celled organisms
