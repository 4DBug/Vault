# Mitochondrion

Membrane-bound [[organelle]] that transforms energy with cellular respiration
`Pl.` mitochondria

> [!info]+ Cellular respiration
> Combustion of glucose to produce [[Adenosine N-Phosphate#Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]
> glucose + $O_2$ -> $CO_2$ +  $H_2O$ + ATP + heat

Number varies with cellular activity

Has two layers of membrane
Outer membrane: smooth and permeable
Inner membrane:

- Folded into cristae to increase the surface area
- Contains enzymes involved in cellular respiration, e.g. ATP synthase
- Inner space, called **matrix**, contains DNA, ribosomes and enzymes.
