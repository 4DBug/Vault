# Mitochondrion

Membrane-bound [[organelle]] that transforms energy with [[cellular respiration]]
`Pl.` mitochondria

Number varies with cellular activity

Has two layers of membrane
Outer membrane: smooth and permeable
Inner membrane:

- Folded into cristae to increase the surface area
- Contains enzymes involved in cellular respiration, e.g. ATP synthase
- Contains **electron transport chain** (`abbr.` ETC)
	- 
- Inner space, called **matrix**, contains DNA, ribosomes and enzymes.
