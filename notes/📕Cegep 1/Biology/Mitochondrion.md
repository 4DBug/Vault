# Mitochondrion

Membrane-bound [[organelle]] that transforms energy with cellular respiration
`Pl.` mitochondria

> [!info] Cellular respiration
> Produces ATP with oxygen
> glucose + $O_2$ -> $CO_2$ +  $H_2O$ + ATP + heat

Number varies with cellular activity

Has two layers of membranes
Inner membrane:

- Smooth and permeable
- Folded into cristae to increase the surface area
- Contains enzymes involved in cellular respiration, e.g. ATP synthase
