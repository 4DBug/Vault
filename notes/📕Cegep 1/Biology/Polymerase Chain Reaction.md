# Polymerase Chain Reaction

DNA amplification (mass replication) technique in vitro
`Abbr.` PCR

Advantages:

- Quick
- Targets specific sequence
- Requires a small amount of DNA

Materials:

- DNA
- Primers: short pieces of single stranded DNA complementary to either end of the template DNA
- dNTPs: nucleotides containing n-bases
	- dATP, dGTP, dTTP, dCTP
- Taq polymerase: thermostable DNA polymerase that synthesizes complementary DNA from dNTPs

Steps:

- Combine the materials in an eppendorf.
- Cycle:
	- Denaturation: the two strands of DNA are separated at high temperature.
		- 95°C
	- Annealing: primers bind to their complementary sequences of DNA.
		- 55°C
	- Polymerization: Taq polymerase synthesizes complementary DNA.
		- 72°C
- Repeat the cycle for exponential amplification.
