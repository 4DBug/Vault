# Allele

One of two or more [[Gene|genes]] that may occur at a locus

> [!abstract]+ Homozygous / heterozygous
> (Of a genotype or pairing of alleles)
> Homozygous: having *identical* alleles for a given trait
> Heterozygous: having *different* alleles for a given trait

## Dominance / recessiveness

(In a heterozygous pairing)
Dominance: *Greater* influence of an allele over the other
Recessiveness: *Lesser* influence of an allele over the other

An allele is completely / partially dominant if it completely / partially masks the expression of its allele.
In some cases there may be multiple codominant alleles.
