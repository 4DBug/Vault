# Adenosine N-Phosphate

Family of nucleotides made of adenine, ribose and *n* phosphates

## Adenosine Triphosphate

`Abbr.` ATP
n = *3*
Energy source of cells, can be stored

Produced by phosphofructokinase (`abbr.` PFK)
Allosteric *inhibitor* of PFK

## Adenosine Diphosphate

`Abbr.` ADP
n = *2*
Not relevant

## Adenosine Monophosphate

`Abbr.` AMP
n = *1*

Produced when ATP is used
Allosteric *activator* of PFK
