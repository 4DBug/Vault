# Adenosine N-Phosphate

Family of nucleotides made of adenine, ribose and *n* phosphates

## Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)

n = *3*
Energy source of cells, can be stored

Produced by phosphofructokinase (PFK)
Allosteric *inhibitor* of PFK

## Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)

n = *2*
Not relevant

## Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)

n = *1*

Produced when ATP is used
Allosteric *activator* of PFK
