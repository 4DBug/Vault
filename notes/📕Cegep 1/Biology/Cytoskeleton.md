# Cytoskeleton

Dynamic network of [[protein]] fibres in the [[cytoplasm]]

## Types

### Microtubule

*Hollow* rod constructed from globular protein **tubulin**
*Thickest*

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Organelle movement
- Chromosome movement
- Cell movement by cilia and flagella

### Microfilament

*Solid* rod constructed from **actin**
*Thinnest*

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Motility
	- Muscle contraction
	- Pseudopodia formation during phagocytosis
- Cell division
- Cytoplasmic streaming

> [!abstract] Motility
> Ability of a cell to move spontaneously and actively

> [!abstract] Cytoplasmic streaming
> Cycle of a stream of cytoplasm in a cell

### Intermediate filament

Diverse class of proteins, including **keratin**
*Medium-size*

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Fixes organelle location
- Maintains the shape of nucleus as part of the nuclear lamina
