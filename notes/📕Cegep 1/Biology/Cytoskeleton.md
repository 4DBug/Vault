# Cytoskeleton

Dynamic network of [[protein]] fibres in the [[cytoplasm]]

## Types

### Microtubule

*Hollow* rod constructed from globular protein **tubulin**
*Thickest*

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Organelle movement
- Chromosome movement
- Cell movement by cilia and flagella

### Microfilament

*Solid* rod constructed from **actin**
*Thinnest*

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Muscle contraction
- Cell movement by pseudopodia formation during phagocytosis
- Cell division
- Cytoplasmic streaming

### Intermediate filament

Diverse class of proteins that contains **keratin**
*Medium-size*

Functions:

- Maintains cell shape
- Fixes organelle location
- Maintains the shape of nucleus as part of the nuclear lamina
