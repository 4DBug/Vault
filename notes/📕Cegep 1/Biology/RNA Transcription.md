# RNA Transcription

Process in which [[Nucleic Acid#Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] makes [[Nucleic Acid#Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]

## Steps

### Initiation

[[Polymerase#RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase]] binds to the **promoter** region upstream of gene and begins unwinding DNA.

### Elongation

### Termination

RNA polymerase transcribes the **terminator** region and unbinds from DNA.
