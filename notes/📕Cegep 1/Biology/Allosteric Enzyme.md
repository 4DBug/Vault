# Allosteric Enzyme

Multi-polypeptide [[enzyme]] involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways
Each polypeptide has its own active site.

Never competitive because it doesn't bind to the active site

> [!abstract] Regulator
> `Coll.` allosteric activators & inhibitors

> [!abstract] Allosteric activator / inhibitor
> Molecule that weakly binds to an allosteric enzyme and stabilizes the *active* / *inactive* form

> [!abstract] Allosteric site
> Location where a regulator binds
