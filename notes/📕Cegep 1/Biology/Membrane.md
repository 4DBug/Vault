# Membrane

Organic isolation layer made of a [[Lipid#^5b5e44|phospholipid bilayer]]

## Associated proteins

### Integral protein

Protein that *penetrates* the membrane

#### Transmembrane protein

Integral protein that extends through the membrane (instead of partway)

Types:

- Channel: has a hydrophilic channel to transport hydrophiles
- Carrier: 

### Peripheral protein

Protein that *loosely associates to* the surface of the membrane

## Transport across membrane

Depends on type and size of molecule and fluidity of the membrane

### Passive transport

Moves solute *down* its concentration gradient (from higher concentration to lower concentration)

*Doesn't require* energy

#### Diffusion

For *hydrophobes*

#### Facilitated diffusion

Variant of diffusion
For *large polar molecules* (e.g. glucose) or *ions*

Requires *channel or carrier* protein

#### Osmosis

Special case of facilitated diffusion
For *water*, which moves against the concentration gradient of solute (a.k.a. down its concentration gradient)

Requires *aquaporin* protein

Continues until the two sides are [[Concentration#Isotonic|isotonic]]

> [!abstract] Aquaporin
> Channel protein for osmosis

### Active transport

Moves solute *against* its concentration gradient (from lower concentration to higher concentration)

Requires *carrier* protein
*Requires* energy provided by the hydrolysis of ATP
