# Membrane

Isolation layer made of [[Lipid#^5b5e44|phospholipid bilayer]]

## Integral protein

Proteins that penetrate the membrane
May extend through the membrane (**transmembrane**) or only partway
Some have a hydrophilic channel allowing passing

Types:

- Channel
- Carrier

## Peripheral protein

Protein loosely associated with the membrane

## Transport across membrane

Depends on fluidity of the membrane

### Passive transport

No energy required

#### Diffusion

Move solute *down* its concentration gradient (from higher concentration to lower concentration)

#### Facilitated diffusion

Variant of diffusion that moves polar or ionic compounds, e.g. glucose

Requires *channel or carrier* protein

#### Osmosis

Special case of facilitated diffusion for water, which moves from lower concentration of solute to higher concentration of solute (a.k.a. from higher concentration of water to lower concentration of water)

Requires *aquaporin* protein

Continues until the two sides are [[Concentration#^d1f583|isotonic]]

> [!abstract] Aquaporin
> Channel integral protein for water

### Active transport

Move solute *against* its concentration gradient (from lower concentration to higher concentration)

Requires *carrier* protein
Requires energy provided by the hydrolysis of ATP
