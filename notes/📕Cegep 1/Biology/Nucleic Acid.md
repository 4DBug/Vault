# Nucleic Acid

[[Polymer]] of [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]] linked by **phosphodiester bonds**
A.k.a. polynucleotide

Formed by dehydration

Function: stores & transmits hereditable information

## Types

### Deoxyribonucleic acid

`Abbr.` DNA
*Two strands* in **antiparallel** (one from 3' to 5', the other from 5' to 3'), whose N-bases are held together by H-bonds
Pentose: *deoxyribose*
N-bases: C-G (triple H-bonds) & A-*T* (double H-bonds)

Functions:

- Makes up chromosomes and genes
- Directs DNA replication
- Directs RNA transcription

### Ribonucleic acid

`Abbr.` RNA
*One strand*
Pentose: *ribose*
N-bases: C-G & A-*U* pairs

#### Messenger

`Abbr.` mRNA
Directs protein translation

Structure:

- 5'-CAP
- Leader sequence
- Coding sequence
- Trailer sequence
- Poly (A) tail

#### Transfer

`Abbr.` tRNA
~90 nt
Acts as a delivery vehicle during protein translation

#### Ribosomal

`Abbr.` rRNA
Makes up the structure of the ribosome
