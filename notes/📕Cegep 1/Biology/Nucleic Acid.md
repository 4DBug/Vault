# Nucleic Acid

[[Polymer]] of [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]] linked by **phosphodiester bonds**
A.k.a. polynucleotide

Formed by dehydration

Function: stores & transmits hereditable information

## Types

### Deoxyribonucleic acid

`Abbr.` DNA
*Double*-stranded, held together by H-bonds
N-bases: C-*T* & A-G pairs

Functions:

- Makes up chromosomes and genes
- Directs its own synthesis through **replication**
- Directs the synthesis of RNA through **transcription**

### Ribonucleic acid

`Abbr.` RNA
*Single*-stranded
N-bases: C-*U* & A-G pairs

#### Messenger

`Abbr.` mRNA
Directs protein synthesis through translation

#### Transfer

`Abbr.` tRNA
Acts as a delivery vehicle during protein synthesis

#### Ribosomal

`Abbr.` rRNA
Makes up the structure of the [[ribosome]]
