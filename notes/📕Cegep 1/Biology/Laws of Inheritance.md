# Laws of Inheritance

Discovered by Mendel

## Law of dominance

An organism with at least one dominant allele displays the effect of the dominant allele.

## Law of segregation

During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete only carries one allele for each gene.

## Law of independent assortment

Genes of different traits segregate independently.
