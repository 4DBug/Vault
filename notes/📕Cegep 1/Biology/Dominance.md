# Dominance

(In a heterozygous pairing of [[Allele|alleles]])
Dominance: *greater* influence of an allele over the other
Recessiveness: *lesser* influence of an allele over the other

## Completeness

Complete dominance: *complete* inhibition of the expression of recessive alleles
Partial / incomplete dominance: *partial* inhibition of the expression of recessive alleles

## Codominance

Mixed expression of multiple alleles

> [!example] A rooster with white and black alleles exhibiting both colours

> [!example] Codominance of A and B alleles makes blood type AB.
