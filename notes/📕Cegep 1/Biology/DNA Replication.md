# [[Nucleic Acid#Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] Replication

**Semiconservative** (one original strand is preserved in each copy)

## Enzymes

- Helicase: enzyme that unwinds DNA strands by breaking H-bonds
- [[Polymerase#DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase]]
- [[Polymerase#Primase|Primase]]

## Steps

### Initiation

1. Helicases bind to origins of replication and begin unwinding DNA to form a **replication bubble** with two **replication forks**, each fork with two strands.
2. Single-stranded binding proteins bind to the template DNA to keep them separated.

### Elongation

Synthesis of the complementary strands

Different for the two strands

#### Leading strand

*5' to 3' continuous* DNA synthesis in the *same* direction of DNA unwinding
*One* RNA primer

1. Primase makes a complementary RNA primer
2. DNA polymerase adds 
3. 

#### Lagging strand

*3' to 5' discontinuous* DNA synthesis in the *opposite* direction of DNA unwinding
*Many* RNA primers

1. Primase makes a complementary RNA primer
2. DNA polymerase adds
