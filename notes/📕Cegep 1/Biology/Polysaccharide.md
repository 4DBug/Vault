# Polysaccharide

Family of [[carbohydrate]]
[[Polymer]] of [[monosaccharide]]

## Members

### Starch

1-4 linkage of *$\alpha$* glucose monomers in the *same* orientation

Carbohydrate storage
*Digestible* by most animals (possess digestive enzymes that can hydrolyse starch)

Forms:

- Amylose: *unbranched*
- Amylopectin: *somewhat branched*

### Cellulose

1-4 linkage of *$\beta$* glucose monomers in *alternating* orientation

Reinforces plant cell walls
*Non digestible* by most animals (lack enzymes)
Cows have bacteria that can break down cellulose

*Unbranched*

### Glycogen

Carbohydrate storage *in liver and muscle*

*Branched*

### Chitin

Structural support *in the cell wall of some fungi and exoskeleton*
