# Golgi Apparatus

Membrane-bound [[Organelle]] in the form of [[Cisterna|cisternae]]
Part of the [[Endomembrane System]]

Functions:

- Modifies glycoproteins ([[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] and [[Protein|proteins]])
- Produces [[Polysaccharide|polysaccharides]]
- Packages proteins into transport [[Vesicle|vesicles]]

Two sides:

- Cis side: receives vesicles from [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]
- Trans side: sends vesicles to other locations in the endomembrane system
	- Some are sent back to ER
	- Some are sent to the [[Plasma Membrane]] for secretion from the cell
