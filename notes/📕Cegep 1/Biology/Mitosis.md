# Mitosis

First part of [[Mitotic (M) Phase|mitotic phase]]
Followed by [[Cytokinesis]]

Properties:

- *1* cell division
- *2 identical* daughter cells

Phases:

- Prophase
- Metaphase
- Anaphase
- Metaphase

## Prophase

First phase of [[Mitosis]] and [[Meiosis]]

Steps:

1. Chromatin fibres condense into discrete chromosomes
2. Nucleoli disappear
3. Microtubules from centrosomes lengthen to form the mitotic spindle
4. Centrosomes move apart to two poles (animal cells only)
5. Nuclear envelope fragments
6. Microtubules attach to chromosomes by kinetochores

> [!abstract] Mitotic spindle
> Formation that grabs chromosomes and pulls them apart
> Made of two centrosomes microtubules

> [!abstract] Centrosome
> T-shaped object that connects the microtubules
> Made of a pair of centrioles

> [!abstract] Kinetochore
> Protein located at the centromere

> [!abstract] Centromere
> Middle section of a pair of chromatids that connects them together

## Metaphase

Second phase of [[Mitosis]] and [[Meiosis]]
Chromosomes move to the metaphase plate, sister chromatids facing opposite poles

## Anaphase

Third phase of [[Mitosis]] and [[Meiosis]]

Steps:

1. Sister chromatids are pulled apart towards opposite poles
2. Microtubules shorten

## Telophase

Fourth phase of [[Mitosis]] and [[Mitosis]]

Steps:

1. Cell elongates
2. Nuclear envelope forms
3. Nucleoli reappear
4. Chromosomes uncoil and begin to decondense into chromatin
