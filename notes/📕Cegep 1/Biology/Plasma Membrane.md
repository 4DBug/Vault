# Plasma Membrane

Outer membrane of the cell
Part of the [[endomembrane system]]

Continuous with [[endoplasmic reticulum]]

## Transport across plasma membrane

See [[Membrane#Transport across membrane]]

### Exocytosis

A transport vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and empties payload outside.
A.k.a. secretion

Requires energy

### Endocytosis

Payload outside is wrapped by the plasma membrane into a transport vesicle.

Requires energy

#### Phagocytosis

Typically for food or enemies

#### Pinocytosis

The formed vesicle is coated by protein.

#### Receptor-mediated endocytosis

Specific molecules outside bind to receptors and are then wrapped.
The formed vesicle is coated by protein.
