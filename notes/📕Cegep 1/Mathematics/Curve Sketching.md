# Curve Sketching

To sketch the curve of a function $f$:

1. Find the domain of $f$.
2. Find the x-intercepts and the y-intercept if possible.
3. Find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of $f$ if possible.
4. Find the intervals of monotonicity of $f$.
5. (Optional) find the relative extrema of $f$.
6. Find the intervals of concavity of $f$.
7. Find the inflection points of $f$.
8. Sketch the graph.
	1. Draw a Cartesian plane.
	2. Plot the x-intercepts, the y-intercept, the H.A., the V.A., the relative extrema, and the inflection points.
	3. Plot $f(x)$ from left to right.
		- Consider the monotonicity and concavity of $f$.
		- Consider the behaviour of $f$ from left and right of V.A.
		- Consider the side of $f$ relative to the H.A.
