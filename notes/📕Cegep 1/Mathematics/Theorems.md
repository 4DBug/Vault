# Theorems

## Differentiability implies continuity

Suppose $f$ is differentiable at $a$.
So,

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{ x \to a } \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
$$

is certain to exist. Now, note that $x \to a$, so $x \ne a$ (i.e. $x - a \ne 0$).
Then,

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) - f(a) & = 
\end{align}
$$

> [!important] The contrapositive of the theorem says non-continuity $\implies$ non-differentiability.

> [!important] The converse is not necessarily true, i.e. continuity doesn't imply differentiability.
